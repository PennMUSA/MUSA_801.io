## Project Description
The Master of Urban Spatial Analytics (MUSA) program at the University of Pennsylvania teaches at the intersection of data science & public policy. In the MUSA Practicum, students work with clients to develop data science tools that can help stakeholders better allocate their limited resources. The course is taught by Professor Ken Steif along with co-instructors Michael Fichman & Matthew Harris. Each project below includes a case study and source code that other cities can adopt for the purposes of replication.
